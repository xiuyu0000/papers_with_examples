class TotalLoss(nn.Cell):
    r"""
    Compute the total loss, which is composed of content loss and style loss.
    Content loss can be computed by:
    .. math::
        L_c(x, c) = \sum_{j \in C} \frac 1 {n_j} \left\| f_j(x) - f_j(c) \right\|_2^2
    Style loss can be computed by:
    .. math::
        L_s(x, s) = \sum_{i \in S} \frac 1 {n_i} \left\| G \left[ f_i(x) \right] - G \left[ f_i(s) \right] \right\|_F^2
    where C and S denote lower and higher layer in VGG model, which was defined in content_weights and style_weights.
    G denotes Gram matrix, which is a square, symmetric matrix measuring the spatially averaged correlation structure
    across the filters within a layer's activations.
    Args:
        in_channel (int): number of input channels.
        content_weights (dict): a dict mapping layer names to their associated content loss weight.
        style_weights (dict): a dict mapping layer names to their associated  style loss weight.

    Inputs:
        - **content** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, 3, H_{in_c}, W_{in_c})`.
        - **style** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, 3, H_{in_s}, W_{in_s})`.
        - **stylized** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, 3, H_{in_o}, W_{in_o})`.

    Outputs:
        Tensor of a single value.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Example:
        >>> content_weight = {"vgg_16/conv3": 1}
        >>> style_weight = {"vgg_16/conv1": 0.5e-3, "vgg_16/conv2": 0.5e-3}
        >>> loss = TotalLoss(3, content_weight, style_weight)
