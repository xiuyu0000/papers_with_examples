def bias_act(x, b=None, dim=1, act='linear', alpha=None, gain=None, clamp=None):
    """
    Slow reference implementation of `bias_act()` using standard TensorFlow ops. Fused bias and activation function.

    Adds bias `b` to activation tensor `x`, evaluates activation function `act`,
    and scales the result by `gain`. Each of the steps is optional. In most cases,
    the fused op is considerably more efficient than performing the same calculation
    using standard ops. It supports first and second order gradients,
    but not third order gradients.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): Input activation tensor. Can be of any shape.
        b (Tensor): Bias vector, or `None` to disable. Must be a 1D tensor of the same type as `x`. Default: None.
        dim (int): The dimension in `x` corresponding to the elements of `b`. Default: 1.
        act (str): Name of the activation function to evaluate, can be `linear` or `lrelu`. Default: ‘linear’.
        alpha (float): Shape parameter for the activation function. Default: None.
        gain (int): Scaling factor for the output tensor, or `None` to use default. Default: None.
        clamp (int): Clamp the output values to `[-clamp, +clamp]`, or `None` to disable the clamping. Default: None.

    Returns:
        Tensor, output tensor of the same shape and datatype as `x`.

    Examples:
        >>> x = bias_act(x=x, b=b, dim=dim, act=act, alpha=alpha, gain=gain, clamp=clamp)
