class Monkaa(SceneflowDataset):
    """
    A source dataset that downloads, reads, parses and augments the Monkaa dataset.

    The generated dataset has five columns :py:obj:`['frame', 'pre_frame', 'optical_flow', 'reverse_optical_flow',
    'motion_boundaries']`.
    The tensor of column :py:obj:`frame` is a matrix of the float32 type.
    The tensor of column :py:obj:`pre_frame` is a matrix of the float32 type.
    The tensor of column :py:obj:`optical_flow` is a matrix of the float32 type.
    The tensor of column :py:obj:`reverse_optical_flow` is a matrix of the float32 type.
    The tensor of column :py:obj:`motion_boundaries` is a matrix of the Bool type.

    Args:
        path (str): The root directory of the monkaa dataset.
        download (bool) : Whether to download the dataset. Default: False.

    About Monkaa dataset:

    The collection contains more than 39000 stereo frames in 960x540 pixel resolution, rendered from various
    synthetic sequences. For details on the characteristics and differences of the three subsets, we refer the reader
    to our paper. The following kinds of data are currently available:

        Segmentations: Object-level and material-level segmentation images.

        Optical flow maps: The optical flow describes how pixels move between images (here, between time steps in a
        sequence). It is the projected screenspace component of full scene flow, and used in many computer vision
        applications.

        Disparity maps: Disparity here describes how pixels move between the two views of a stereo frame. It is a
        formulation of depth which is independent of camera intrinsics (although it depends on the configuration of
        the stereo rig), and can be seen as a special case of optical flow.

        Disparity change maps: Disparity alone is only valid for a single stereo frame. In image sequences,
        pixel disparities change with time. This disparity change data fills the gaps in scene flow that occur when
        one uses only optical flow and static disparity.

        Motion boundaries: Motion boundaries divide an image into regions with significantly different motion. They
        can be used to better judge the performance of an algorithm at discontinuities.

        Camera data: Full intrinsic and extrinsic camera data is available for each view of every stereo frame in our
        dataset collection.
