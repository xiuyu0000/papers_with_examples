    RetinaFace with loss.

    Args:
        network(nn.Cell): The RetinaFace network structure.
        multibox_loss(nn.Cell): The MultiBoxLoss use for training.
        config(dict): A configuration dictionary, it should contains loc_weight, class_weight and landm_weight.

    Inputs:
        img(Tensor): Input images,which shape is [B,C,H,W].
        loc_t(Tensor): Ground truth of bounding boxes, load from dataset.
        conf_t(Tensor): Ground truth of confidence, load from dataset.
        landm_t(Tensor): Ground truth of landmarks, load from dataset.

    Returns:
        A tensor, represents the loss of forward pass.
