    MLP-Mixer Architecture implementation.

    Args:
        image_size (int): Input image size. Default: 224.
        input_channels (int): The number of input channel. Default: 3.
        patch_size (int): Patch size of image. Default: 16.
        num_blocks (int): Number of Blocks of MixerBlock to use.
        hidden_dim (int): The hidden dimension of the model - number of channels.
        token_mlp_dim (int): The tunable hidden widths in the token-mixing MLP.
        channel_mlp_dim (int): The tunable hidden widths in the channel-mixing MLP.
        keep_prob (float): The keep rate, greater than 0 and less equal than 1. Default: 1.0.
